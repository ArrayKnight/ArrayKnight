## Hi 🖐

I'm Ray, a Senior Frontend Architect, currently working @ [GenUI](https://www.genui.com/) in Seattle, WA, USA.

### Future Plans 🥂

My partner and I are looking to move to Europe (preferably AT, DE, CH, LU). Which means that I am looking for a sponsor for a work visa. If you represent a company that could help, I'd greatly appreciate reaching out to me to discuss details.

### Follow Along 🛸
